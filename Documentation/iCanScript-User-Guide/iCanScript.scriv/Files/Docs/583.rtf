Disruptive software was founded in 2010 by industry veterans, to create iCanScript:\'a0 A powerful visual scripting development aid for the Unity 3D Game Engine.\'a0 The idea was born from experience in large gaming companies, as well as innovating the designing of advanced development tools in other software industries.\'a0 iCanScript provides a visual scripting environment that has a one-to-one mapping with Unity API\'92s, and can be used to create full games without a single line of code.\'a0 Our goal is to provide a tool that simplifies the programming experience.\'a0 One that can empower non-programers to develop the skills to create software constructs visually, without diving into endless lines of code \'85 yet at the same time allow expert developer to increase productivity by focusing on design. \'a0 iCanScript is designed to co-exist with code and other tools, so a mix of technologies can be used when best suited.}
